## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, Profiles (~2 days)
Implementation of user authentication and personal profiles. By the end of this
phase, a user will be able to log in and customize their profiles. I will deploy
to Heroku as soon as this is achieved.

[Details][phase-one]

### Phase 2: Posts, mentions, likes and comments (~2.5 days)
The primary focus of this phase will be posts. User will be able to CRUD posts.
By the end of this phase, users will be able to mention other users, like and
comment on posts.

[Details][phase-two]

### Phase 3: Friend requests (~2 days)
By the end of this phase, users will be able to send/receive friend requests
to/from other users and will be able to accept or deny them.

[Details][phase-three]

### Phase 4: Seed data (~0.5 day)
To be able to demo a efficient search feature I will need a lot of seed data.
The target of this phase will be to add ~1,000 fake users using faker. Seed data
will have profile pictures (celebrity or anime pictures will do). Seed data
for friendships and posts will also be required to demo the search feature in an
appealing way.

[Details][phase-four]

### Phase 5: Search (~1 day)
By the end of this phase a user will be able to search for other user by name,
location, school or workplace. The search results will be ranked by friends,
mutual friends, location and age.

[Details][phase-five]
